        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which remained with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company. As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes,
                and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
                With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.
                They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town.The
                brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river. Both brothers were killed
                while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later
                buried with honor.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
                joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the
                Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. He fought in
                and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along
                with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the Lonely
                Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.
                lóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves

                accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
                advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother
                of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and Thorin
                Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
